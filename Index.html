                        <li> <b class="putpasta"> Put pasta water on to boil</b> <br> 
                            Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) <br>
                             on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water <br>
                              to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), <br>
                               so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li> <br>

                               <li> <b class="brownbeef"> Brown the ground beef</b> <br> 
                                In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. <br>
                                Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. <br> <br>
                                Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a <br>
                                 tablespoon of fat.</li> <br>

                                 <li>
                                   <b> Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef </b> <br> <br>
Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet 

Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the <br>
 peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute <br>
  more.
Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce <br>
 the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes. 
                                 </li> <br>

                 <li><b> Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce </b> <br> 
                      Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. <br>
                       Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot. <br>
                    <br>                
                  Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the <br>
                   amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to <br>
                    taste. <br>
                                    
                  Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at <br>
                   a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar <br>
                    needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you <br>
                     are using.) <br>
                                    
                Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, <br>
                 which is salty. <br>
                                    
              Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a <br>
               low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the <br>
                bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom <br>
             Remove from heat. 
             and scorches. <br> </li>
                   
             <li>
               <b> Boil and drain the lasagna noodles </b> <br> 
By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be <br>
 boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, <br>
  per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.) <br>
  <br>

Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at <br>
 a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from <br>
  sticking. <br>

When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently <br> 
separating any noodles that may be sticking together. <br>

Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out <br>
 the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get <br>
  coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from <br>
   sticking together.
             </li>
 <li>
   <b> Heat the oven to 375°F</b>
 </li>                    
 <li>
   <b> Assemble the lasagna </b> <br> 
In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and <br>
 spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna <br>
  noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, <br>
   depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.
<br>
Sprinkle a layer of a third of <br>
 the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna <br> sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops <br>
  every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese <br>
   evenly over the top of ricotta cheese. <br>

Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining <br>
 sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta <br>
  cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan. <br>

Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce <br>
 over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining <br>
  Mozzarella cheese.
 </li>               
 <li>
  <b>Bake</b> <br> 
Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it <br>
 doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. <br>
  Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>Cool and serve </b> <br> 
Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will <br>
 keep for about 5 days. May be reheated in conventional oven or <br>
  microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the <br>
   aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
 </li>
